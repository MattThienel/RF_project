### Tutorial

After installing the Arduino IDE onto your machine you will have to install the VirtualWire Library. Either download it from the link provided or use the zip file found on this github repository. To add the .zip file to the Arduino IDE, find Sketch in the top menu, then click Include Library and Add .ZIP Library. From there select the correct zip file and the library is installed. At this point you can open the Arduino project files provided, compile and run them on the arduino. The default configuration for the rf module used (HiLetgo 315Mhz RF Transmitter and Receiver Module) utilizes pin 12 on the arduino for the data pin on each module.
